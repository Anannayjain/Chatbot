However, the data in different dimensions is highly correlated, and using techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), the data can be compressed to a lower dimension without significant loss in information.\\nHowever, these methods require either manual tuning of hyperparameters or the rank to be known.

Then they would modify the map within permissible limits such that the ownership boundaries in the map follow hedgerows or farm boundaries. This manual process requires a few days of work for one village and is prone to error. The GoM would have to move many resources to accomplish this project for 40k villages in Maharastra.\\nWe proposed a pipeline of automation algorithms to modernise the land records using segmented satellite images and digitised village maps, thus reducing the work time for a village from a few days to a few minutes.

Myerson gave a fundamental result that defined incentive-compatible auctions and revenue optimality. However, when information is spread via agents in a network, the result does not hold. This is because the agents need to be incentivized to spread the information. Recently, a few mechanisms have been proposed that incentivize buyers to forward auction information in their networks. This work involves investigating the properties of a new class of mechanisms based on a Myerson-like characterization of incentive-compatible auctions on a network. In particular, a special subclass called referral auctions is considered, inspired by the multi-level marketing mechanisms, and obtain the structure of the revenue optimal referral auction for i.i.d. bidders.\\nAny courses you completed relevant to the project', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/2022-07-22-Parvik-Dave/'}),\n",

But I wanted to do something related to this, and so this came naturally when I was looking for a project for my BTP. I approached Prof. Swaprava Nath to work on something in this field. Since I’d already covered significant ground beforehand through my SoS project, we got started almost immediately as part of BTP-I. We were working on finding a characterization for all truthful auction mechanisms in the case of diffusion auctions. The work during BTP-I was mostly theoretical, except for some simulations that were performed to test out our designed mechanisms. We went on to submit a paper at a conference for this, the results of which are still awaited. As part of BTP-II, I continued the work on finding the optimal mechanism and extending our work. This involved LP to solve optimal mechanisms for smaller networks, and then building the intuition to create a rigorous proof for the structure of optimal mechanisms. On a tangent, I also started working on multi-object network based auctions, which is a direct extension of single-object network based auctions, during summers.

Here, we first introduce an attention-based neural gadget that leverages the graph structure of architectures and acts as a surrogate to trained deep neural networks for quick model prediction. Then, we use these predictions to build subset samplers. This naturally provides us two variants of SubSelNet. The first variant is transductive (called Transductive-SubSelNet), which computes the subset separately for each model by solving a small optimization problem. Such an optimization is still super fast, thanks to the replacement of explicit model training by the model approximator. The second variant is inductive (called Inductive-SubSelNet), which computes the subset using a trained subset selector, without any optimization.

If not, talk to people who know what they’re talking about, use the Internet, look at what different programmes cover, and find out what looks best for you.\\nThat being said, this is a blog primarily for PhD applicants, simply because that is what I was myself. Much of the process might be identical for Master’s applicants (but not MBA) as well, but it would be dishonest to say that with any authority. On the rare occasions I am sure of something also holding for/being directly contradictory to the Master’s process, I make that explicit.\\nPrerequisites:', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/2022-10-02-Adway_Grad_Apping/'}),\n",

I realise that most of you are reading this at exactly this point or later, so this is more for me to set context than anything else. If you’re looking for a PhD, you should have good research experience. This is helped if supplemented by research internships and publications, but they’re not the be-all and end-all: I had neither in my application and still got into one of my top 3 picks (this is also heavily field and topic dependent).

Finding slots may get harder later into the season, so it’s best to be done with these formalities as early as possible (I wrote both separated by only the first week of the Fall semester). There are books that provide neat tips for both, which you may or may not find on typical book-finding websites that may or may not be legal. While nearly all universities require TOEFL, an increasing number no longer have the GRE as a mandatory requirement. If you find that most of your target universities (more on this later) don’t need the GRE, you may consider skipping it. For more information on the exact modality of these tests, look around the ETS website.', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/2022-10-02-Adway_Grad_Apping/'}),\n",

The amount of preparation you need for the GRE can be anywhere from weeks to months, depending on both your ability to write and your knowledge of uncommon words that ETS likes. The most efficient way to improve the latter is by using a GRE-specific flashcard app (such as Magoosh, which I used); the former comes through practice and familiarising yourself with possible writing prompts (all 300-odd of which are available on the ETS website). Apart from English, you will also be tested on your basic mathematical ability in the quantitative section; it’s unlikely that you will require too much (or any) preparation for this. It’s a good idea to attempt two practice tests: one after a few days of preparation, when you think you have a good idea of what to expect in the test, and one a day or two before the actual test. The goal is to finish with 325+ (out of 340) and 4+ (out of 6) in the writing section (being slightly under will not be terrible if you have an otherwise incredible profile).

I had 116, with 30 each in reading and listening, and 28 each in speaking and writing.\\nIdentification:\\nThis is a process that starts fairly early on, but one that takes long and deserves a good bit of attention. The first step is to figure out what areas to apply to, based on your experience and interests. They shouldn’t be too specific, but shouldn’t be from unrelated domains; you want a common thread running through those topics (that you will look to describe in your Statement of Purpose - more on that later).', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/2022-10-02-Adway_Grad_Apping/'}),\n",

You can also send your scores to 4 universities for free during the registration/test, as opposed to later (when you have to pay additionally to send scores of tests that you paid to write). This list could come from anywhere - research groups whose works you may be familiar with, places you know seniors from similar areas have gone to, perhaps even plainly looking at university names from global ranking lists - but you should also ask professors that you are currently working/have worked with for advice and recommendations. For each university, make a list of faculty whose works interest you and scour their websites - What areas are they/will they be working on? Do they want new students? Are they going on a 2-year sabbatical starting next year? Are they taking up a new position elsewhere? Do they require that you email them apart from applying to the programme if you wish to work with them? - every bit of relevant information helps. Thus begins the process of pruning your list to a target of 10. You can take as long as you want right until the deadlines, in principle, but it’s best to have your 10 settled in early November, along with a handful of professors from each (it’s a good idea to have at least 3-4 people that interest you at each university; they are humans after all and you do not want your future resting on the shoulders of a single fickle mind). Your 10 should be split into 3 categories: around 3-4 long shots (that are above your level - an honest assessment of where you stand is needed, seniors from similar areas and the professors you work with are your best sources for this), 3-4 achievables (that are realistic but not essentially guaranteed) and 3-4 safes (where you are basically assured of admittance, but still places that you would be happy going to). My 10 were: MIT, EPFL, Stanford, Caltech, Cambridge, UIUC, UT Austin, UCLA, UCSD, and Purdue (in order, 4 long shots, 4 achievables, 2 safes).', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/2022-10-02-Adway_Grad_Apping/'}),\n",

For this, with at least around 2 months to go until the deadlines (but the sooner the better, it becomes easier and more expected if you’ve already discussed your application and possible target universities with them earlier), you ask them, ideally in-person if possible, if they would be willing to write you a “strong LoR” (which also makes it easier for them to say “no” instead of “yes” but not really helping your application with an average LoR).

For the Software profile, I reviewed C programming and brushed up on basic algorithms. During the interviews, the Digital and Analog interviews were highly technical, with minimal focus on the points mentioned in my resume. Conversely, the Software interview was relatively relaxed, with a couple of C programming questions and inquiries about my resume.

It was the first for me, and I loved it. Japan is a beautiful and peaceful country to live in. The language barrier and cuisine might be a bit of a problem for us. I used a lot of Google Translate, and I had my co-interns from India to travel with.

You are taught the basic principles of flight, using simple equations and plenty of illustrations. There is generally plenty of audio-visual content, and lectures at times seem more like scientific documentaries. While I did this course offline, there were three course projects as well that were quite fun and hands-on (one of them involved a glider competition).

Prof Nivethida’s module had formula based computations in the examinations while Prof Soni’s module was entirely theoretical. Following the lectures was especially important for Prof Nivethida’s module as the concepts would be difficult to grasp if one relied solely on the lecture slides. Additional practice questions and resources were handed out in ungraded assignments the answer keys to which were shared later, for Prof Nivethida’s module. Attendance of 80% was mandatory for the classes and examinations. The instructor occasionally conducted additional tutorial sessions for doubt clearing apart from the weekly classes.\\nFeedback on Evaluations', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/Minor%20Course%20Reviews/Autumn_Minors/BB603_review/'}),\n",

This is followed by an indepth coverage of data visualisation techniques. Then there is a very brief coverage of fundamental machine learning models like decision trees, support vector machines and neural networks. Do not expect to get a very rigorous mathematical coverage of these models, only a basic intuition. The last few lectures cover basics of deep learning and focus on its practice and tools commonly used. There is a lecture on SQL and important ideas like map-reduce.\\nFeedback on Lectures:', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/Minor%20Course%20Reviews/Autumn_Minors/DS203_review/'}),\n",

You will be in a good position to understand more advanced machine learning texts using the fundamentals learnt in this course.\\nFeedback on Evaluations:\\nA large part of the course evaluation was programming assignments which needed a good amount of time, especially if you are new to python. These were graded fairly. A fairly easy objective-question based midsem was also conducted. Another major chunk was the end-term project which was done in groups of two or three.

We had to submit lab reports every week- these were to be strictly made in LaTeX and the circuit diagrams included, in X-circuit. Each week’s experiments were on topics that we’d already done previously in some theory course so the labs were fairly easy.\\nThe experiments covered were:\\nLab1: Introduction to NGSpice\\nLab 2: DC Power Supply\\nLab 3: Half-wave and full-wave precision rectifiers\\nLab 4: Schmitt trigger, Astable mulitvibrator, Monostable mulitvibrator', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/Core%20Course%20Reviews/Spring_Core/EE230_Review_2022/'}),\n",

The homeworks weren’t very time taking nor were they conceptually tough. Each lab session began with a 10 minutes moodle quiz. Study material for the week’s topic was provided in advance and the quiz consisted of both theory questions and questions involving calculations. The labs themselves involved forming actual circuits, supplying inputs to it and taking readings, usually followed by plotting the results / characteristics.

For the post midsem part of the semester which discussed RISC/CISC Design and Pipelined implementation lecture notes were sufficient.\\nFollow-up Courses\\nEE337- Microprocessor Lab ,EE739-Processor Design, CS683/EE748- Advanced Computer Architecture.\\nFinal Takeaway\\nThis course build up on your knowledge of digital systems, so if you were intrigued by the concepts taught in digital systems it will be a very interesting course.

The course followed the Microprocessor course heavily. The first 7 labs covered Assembly programming in 8051, and the last lab covered programming in Embedded C. Each lab builds up over the previous lab, so it is important to understand the content of every lab.

It is important to understand the flow of assembly programs and 8051 instructions with its associated registers. It is also necessary that you understand how to debug an assembly language program, because the logical errors are not as obvious as compared to a C program; so make sure you are familiar with the software (ARM Keil µVision 5).\\nThe Embedded C section is fairly easy if you have prior C experience. The course did not cover this section in depth, limiting oneself to filling up certain values for communication protocol functioning. The focus here was more on understanding how to read datasheets and trying to find out what values of registers would correctly implement the timing diagrams provided.\\nFeedback on Evaluations', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/Core%20Course%20Reviews/Spring_Core/EE337_2022_review/'}),\n",

Also, in the labsheets on communication protocols, questions were asked on the protocol itself, although it was not covered anywhere, so make sure you read up on how the protocol works, and the associated pins for the protocol to work.\\nEnd-Sem: It had questions both on assembly programming and embedded-C. The questions were fairly straightforward, but most people ran into hardware issues, and sorting them out was difficult.

We will study basic passive (which do not produce any power themselves i.e. there is never any gain involved) used in microwave systems. These include impedance matching networks (using Smith Charts), couplers, attenuators, phase shifters power combiner/divider, amplifiers, oscillators, etc. Electromagnetic theory is combined with Network Theory. This course helps us to design electrical circuits using microstrip transmission lines and also classical lumped elements. Basic parameters used in designs of microwave systems (S parameters, ABCD, impedance issues etc.) are also discussed.', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/Elective%20Reviews/Devices/EE614_2019/'}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Prerequisites – This course doesn’t require any hard and fast prerequisites but EE301 knowledge is helpful for understanding the course content better. A basic EM waves course helps as it is highly dependent on concepts like transmission line and smith chart. The instructor recommends a basic circuit course and an introduction to network theory.\\nCourse Content:\\nLectures – Lectures were conducted with the aid of slides which were provided to students. The pace of the lectures were slow and the professor gave ample time to learn the concepts. The professor focused on the derivation of formulae. The lectures slides are concise and adequate for the examinations.\\nAssignments and Tutorials – Tutorials were conducted to discuss some problems. No assignments were given.\\nExams – Exams comprised of 2 quizzes (10% each), midsem (30%), endsem (40%) and course project (10%). Exams were mostly based on tutorial discussions, slides and problems from a reference book.', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/Elective%20Reviews/Devices/EE614_2019/'}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Exams – Exams comprised of 2 quizzes (10% each), midsem (30%), endsem (40%) and course project (10%). Exams were mostly based on tutorial discussions, slides and problems from a reference book.\\nCourse Project – The problem statement was given right at the start giving ample time to think. It was to design a power amplifier using AFIC901N for a gain of at least 20 dB at 520 MHz with some more specifications. However, it used the software ADS for which the instructor could procure the license for only a month, in which the second week was midsem week resulting in not many students being able to finish it and relying on Antennae/VLSI lab. The students had to make a group of two to four and fabricate and solder a PCB of their and conduct tests on it. The design project helps the students to learn the practical difficulties which entails while designing a microwave circuit. The professor kept 5% weightage for the presentation and 5% for the report.\\nDifficulty – Easy\\nGrading – Lenient', metadata={'source': 'https://ee-damp.github.io/Elective%20Reviews/Devices/EE614_2019/'}),\n",
